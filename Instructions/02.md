# Exercise 2: Governance

## Context

Migrations have gone well. However, there are no strict governance established across the organization. 
Tailwind Traders need to establish recommended best practices for governance and a way to audit that no deployments have been made that bypass those rules. This audit needs to scale across the entire organization.

- Enable Resource Consistency
- Enable Security Baseline
- Enable Cost Management

CAF Migration landing zone implementation option does not implement any governance tooling and is being used for limited production deployment to initiate learning, iteration, and development of the overall operating model in parallel to these early stage migration efforts. To accelerate parallel development of governance disciplines, you will be deploying the **CAF Foundation blueprint** in this exercise.

## Reference architecture

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) Foundation blueprint deploys a set of core infrastructure resources and policy controls required for your first production grade Azure application. This foundation blueprint is based on the recommended pattern found in CAF.

The CAF Foundation blueprint sample deploys recommended infrastructure resources in Azure that can be used by organizations to put in place the foundation controls necessary to manage their cloud estate. This sample will deploy and enforce resources, policies, and templates that will allow an organization to confidently get started with Azure.

This implementation incorporates several Azure services used to provide a secure, fully monitored, enterprise-ready foundation. You will explore the resources deployed and policy definitions available with this blueprint in the below tasks.

>You will see **DeploymentID** value on the Environment details tab, please use it wherever you see DeploymentID in lab steps. This is a unique number associated with each lab deployment.

>Note: **L2-Governance Sub-Suffix** subscription is used to perform this exercise.

#### Task 1: Deploy the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Foundation blueprint sample

In this task you will deploy the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) Foundation blueprint sample. The CAF Foundation blueprint does not deploy a landing zone. Instead, it deploys the tools required to establish a governance MVP (minimum viable product) to begin developing your governance disciplines.

The below steps must be followed to deploy the Azure Blueprints CAF Migration landing zone blueprint sample:

- Create a new blueprint from the sample
- Mark your copy of the sample as Published
- Assign your copy of the blueprint to an existing subscription

1. From the Azure portal , type **Blueprint** at the search bar and select **Blueprints** under services. You will be redirected to **Blueprints| Getting started** page.

     >**TTDeploymentIDApplication-rg, TTDeploymentIDVnet-rg and TTDeploymentIDIdentity-rg** are empty resource groups.
     
     ![](images/ex2-rgs.png)
       
20. Select the resource group **TTDeploymentIDSharedSvcs-rg** and review the deployed resources.
      - An **Azure Key Vault** instance used to host secrets used for the VMs deployed in the shared services environment
      - **Log Analytics** is deployed to ensure all actions and services log to a central location from the moment you start your secure deployment in to Storage Accounts for diagnostic logging
      - And a **Storage account** is created to store the diagnostic files.
      
     ![](images/ex2-ttsharedrg.png)

     ![](images/ex2v1-policy.png)
     
#### Task 2: Enable Resource Consistency

In this task you will explore the resources and policies deployed by the blueprint **CAFFoundationzone** in the previous task.

1.  Navigate to **Blueprints** page under the **Blueprint definitions** section, select **L2-CAFFoundationzone** then Click on **Edit blueprint**.
   
    ![](images/ex2-10-editbp1.png)
    
    >Select the scope **L2-Governance Sub-Suffix** if it is set to different subscription.
    
2. On the **Edit blueprint** click on **Next:Artifacts>>** and **explore the artifacts** included by default with the **CAF Foundation Zone** blueprint sample.
    
   ![](images/ex2-03-artifacts.png)
   
   **The blueprint is composed of following artifacts:**
   - **Azure Security Center** (standard version) provides threat protection for your migrated workloads
   - An **Azure Key Vault** instance used to host secrets used for the VMs deployed in the shared services environment
   - **Log Analytics** is deployed to ensure all actions and services log to a central location from the moment you start your secure deployment in to Storage Accounts for diagnostic logging

   **The blueprint also defines and assigns the following Azure Policy assignments:**

   - Append CostCenter TAG & its value from the Resource Group : This policy appends the specified tag **CostCenter** and its value to the **resources from the resource groups** if resources are missing this tag when created or updated.
   
   - Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups:This policy appends the specified tag **CostCenter** and its value to **resource groups** if any resource group is missing this tag when created or updated. 
   
   - Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center
   
   - Allowed locations

   - Allowed locations for resource groups

   - Deploy network watcher when virtual networks are created 

   - Resource Types that you do not want to allow in your environment : You can select only the resource types which are needed for the environment and restrict the other resources by enforcing this policy.

   - Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled 

   - Allowed storage account SKUs

   - Allowed virtual machine SKUs
   
3. You can see the policy assignment **Resource Types that you do not want to allow in your environment** is used to restrict unwanted resource types, which will help in optimizing the cost.
   >Note: You will be selecting the resource types which you want to deny while assigning the blueprint.

4. And also to prevent any accidental deletion of resources we will be enforcing the **resource level locks**.
   >Note: You will be selecting the lock types that you want to apply while assigning the blueprint.

#### Task 3: Security Baseline

    >CAF Foundation zone blueprint is deployed in `L2-Governance Sub-Suffix` so we are setting the scope for this subscription.

#### Task 4: Cost management

 In this task you will learn how to use **tags** to manage costs. **Tags** are a effective way to track costs by organizing the resources that span across multiple teams and Azure scopes. After you plan for resource tagging, you can configure an Azure policy to enforce tagging on resources. When tags are applied properly, you can apply them as a filter in **cost analysis** which helps in better understanding of cost and usage patterns.

#### Subtask1: Explore the policies applied to manage the cost.
 
1. **Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups**
    
   The policy Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups appends the specified tag **CostCenter** and its value to **resource groups** if any resource group is missing this tag when created or updated. 
   
   ![](images/ex2-14-costrgtag1.png)
 
2. **Append CostCenter TAG & its value from the Resource Group**
   
   The policy Append CostCenter TAG & its value from the Resource Group appends the specified tag **CostCenter** and its value to the **resources from the resource groups** if resources are missing this tag when created or updated.
   
   >Note: Both the policy definitions **Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups** and **Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups** are by default included with the blueprint sample **CAFFoundation**
