# Exercise 1: Start Small and Expand Migrate Landing Zone

## Context

Tailwind Traders is planning to migrate initial set of workloads from on-premises to cloud. They need a reference architecture to deploy and enforce resources, policies, and templates that will allow them to confidently get started with Azure.

In this exercise, you will create a blueprint definition based on **CAF Migration Landing Zone** and assign it at the subscription level to get start started with Azure. Also, you will update the blueprint to match DMS Network architecture.

## Reference architecture

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure **(CAF) Migration landing zone** blueprint is a set of infrastructure to help you set up for migrating your first workload to azure and manage your cloud estate in alignment with CAF.

The CAF Migration landing zone blueprint sample deploys foundation infrastructure resources in Azure that can be used by organizations to prepare their subscription for migrating virtual machines in to. It also helps put in place the governance controls necessary to manage their cloud estate. This sample will deploy and enforce resources, policies, and templates that will allow an organization to confidently get started with Azure.

This environment is composed of several Azure services used to provide a secure, fully monitored, enterprise-ready governance.You will explore the resources deployed with this blueprint in the below tasks.

>You will see DeploymentID value on the Lab Environment tab, please use it wherever you see DeploymentID in lab steps. This is a unique number associated with each lab deployment.

#### Task 1: Deploy the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure migrate landing zone blueprint sample

Azure landing zones are the output of a multisubscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security, governance, networking, and identity and a migration landing zone is an environment that has been provisioned and prepared to host workloads that are being migrated from an on-premises environment into Azure.
 
In this task, you will create a blueprint definition based on CAF Migration Landing Zone and also explore the capabilities it provides.

The below steps must be followed to deploy the Azure Blueprints CAF Migration landing zone blueprint sample:

- Recommended to deploy the CAF Foundation blueprint sample
- Create a new blueprint from the sample
- Mark your copy of the sample as Published
- Assign your copy of the blueprint to an existing subscription

1. From the Azure portal, type **Blueprint** at the search bar and select **Blueprints** under services. You will be redirected to **Blueprints| Getting started** page.
   
   ![](images/ex1-00-searchblueprint.png) 
   
   >Note: Blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions. This allows Cloud Architects to design environments that comply with organizational standards and best practices – enabling your app teams to get to production faster. Using blueprints you can compose artifacts such as templates, policies, role assignments, and resource groups based on common or organization-based patterns into re-usable blueprints.
   
2. From the **Blueprints| Getting started** page, under the **Create a blueprint** header click on **Create**. This will redirect to **Create blueprint** page.

   ![](images/ex1-01-createblueprint.png)

3. On the **Create blueprint** page, under the **Choose a blueprint sample** header, type **CAF** at the search bar and select the predefined blueprint sample **CAF Migration Landing zone**.

   ![](images/ex1-02-bpmigrationlandingzone.png) 
 
4. On the **Create blueprint** page create the blueprint with the following characteristics:

   - **Name**: `L1-MigrationLandingzone`
   - **Blueprint description**: Leave the default description
   - **Definition location**: Click on **ellipse (**...**)** symbol.
   
   ![](images/ex1-03-blueprintname-description.png) 
   
5. Next, set the **Definition Location** value to a subscription named **L1-MigrationLZ Sub-DeploymentID** and then click on **Select** and return back to the Create blueprint page.
     
   ![](images/ex1-04-blueprint-scope.png) 
  
   >The definition location determines the **scope** that the blueprint may be assigned to, the management group or subscription where the blueprint is saved.

6. Click on **Next:Artifacts>>** section and explore the artifacts included along with the **CAF Migration Landing zone blueprint**.
   
   ![](images/ex1-05-artifacts.png) 
   
   The blueprint is composed of following artifacts:
   - An **Azure Key Vault** instance used to host secrets used for the Certificates, Keys, and Secrets deployed in the shared services environment
   - **Log Analytics** is deployed to ensure all actions and services log to a central location from the moment you start your migration
   - **Azure Virtual Network** providing an isolated network and subnets for your virtual machine.
   - **Azure Migrate Project** for discovery and assessment ,to add the tools for Server assessment, Server migration, Database assessment, and Database migration.
   
7. After exploring the artifacts click on **Save Draft** to save the blueprint configurations as draft.

   >Note: When a blueprint is first created, it's considered to be in Draft mode. When it's ready to be assigned, it needs to be Published , so the next step is to **publish the blueprint**.

8. Navigate to the **Blueprints** blade then under the **Blueprint definitions** section select the blueprint definition **L1-MigrationLandingzone**.
   
9. Click on **Publish blueprint**.

   ![](images/ex1-06-publishbp.png) 

10. Enter the version as **v1.0** and click on **Publish** to publish the blueprint.
 
    ![](images/ex1-06-publish.png) 
 
    >Note: Publishing requires defining a **Version** string (letters, numbers, and hyphens with a max length of 20 characters) along with optional **Change notes**. 
 The Version differentiates it from future changes to the same blueprint and allows each version to be assigned. This versioning also means different Versions of the same blueprint can be assigned to the same subscription.
 
 11. Once the copy of the blueprint sample has been successfully published it can be assigned to a subscription it was saved to.
 
 12. Now navigate to the **Blueprints** blade then under the **Blueprint definitions** section select the published blueprint definition **L1-MigrationLandingzone**.
 
 13. Then select **Assign blueprint** option at the top of the blueprint definition page. 
     
     ![](images/ex1-07-assignbp.png) 
      
 14. On the **Assign blueprint** page , provide the parameter values for the blueprint assignment:
    
     **Basics**
     - **Subscriptions**: Choose the subscription `L1-MigrationLZ Sub-DeploymentID` where your copy of the blueprint sample is saved to.
       
     - **Assignment name:** The name is pre-populated for you based on the name of the blueprint `Assignment-L1-Migrationlandingzone`.
       
     - **Location:** `CentralUS`
       >Region for the managed identity to be created in. Azure Blueprint uses this managed identity to deploy all artifacts in the assigned blueprint.
       
     - **Blueprint definition version:** `v1.0`
       >Pick a Published version of your copy of the blueprint sample.
       
     - **Lock Assignment:** Leave the default value
       
     - **Managed Identity:** Choose the default **system assigned** managed identity option.

     **Blueprint parameters:** 
       >The parameters defined in this section are used by many of the artifacts in the blueprint definition to provide consistency.
    
     - **Organization:** Enter your organization name as `TWTL1-DeploymentID`
     - **AzureRegion:** `CentralUS`
       
       ![](images/ex1-08-assignblueprint.png) 

     **Artifact parameters**
       
       >The parameters defined in this section apply to the artifact under which it's defined. These parameters are dynamic parameters since they're defined during the assignment of the blueprint. 
       
      - **Deploy key vault:** Provide the **ObjectID** value 
         >Get the ObjectID value from the **Lab Environment** tab.
      
      - **Deploy log analytics:** `30` that is the value for number of days the data will be retained in Log Analytics.
        
        **Region:** `CentralUS`
      
      - **Deploy vNET Landing zone :** Provide the Virtual Network IP Address space as `10.0`
      
      - **Deploy Azure Migrate:**`CentralUS`
       
        Once all parameters have been entered, select **Assign** at the bottom of the page.
        
        ![](images/ex1-09-assignblueprint.png) 

15. Now the blueprint assignment is created and the artifact deployment begins. This deployment will take around **five** minutes. 

16. To check on the status of deployment, open the blueprint assignment **Assignment-L1-Migrationlandingzone** from the **Blueprints** page and **Assigned blueprints** section.
 
    ![](images/ex1-12-assignmentdeploying.png)
 
17. After the assignment is **Succeeded** review the deployed resources by the blueprint.

18. In the upper left corner of the portal window, to open the Resource Groups menu, click the toggle menu icon and then click on **Resource groups**.
    
    ![](images/ex1-resourcegroups.png)
    
    This blade displays all of the resource groups that you have access to the Azure subscriptions.

19. As you can see three resource groups named **-Migrate-rg, -SharedSvcs-rg and -VNet-rg** are created by the blueprint.

    ![](images/ex1-resourcegroupsnames.png)
    
20. Review the deployed resources in each resource groups.

21. Under the **Resource groups** blade Click on **Migrate-rg** and then Click on **Show Hidden types** to see the resources created in this resource group.

    ![](images/ex1-15-migratergrp.png)
   
    You should see a **migration project** deployed for discovery and assessment,to add the tools for Server assessment, Server migration, Database assessment, and Database migration.
   
    >Some ancillary resources are created/managed by Azure infrastructure. The Portal does not display these resources by default. Toggle this checkbox **Show Hidden types** if you want to show/hide them. Displaying them is typically useful when you want to clean up your resource groups or subscriptions.
    
22. Now return to the **Resource groups** blade and click on **SharedSvcs-rg** and review the deployed resources.
    
    ![](images/ex1-14-svsrg.png)
  
    - An **Azure Key Vault** instance used to host secrets used for the Certificates, Keys, and Secrets deployed in the shared services environment
    - **Log Analytics** is deployed to ensure all actions and services log to a central location from the moment you start your migration.
    - And a **Storage account** to store the diagnostic files.
   
23. Again return to the **Resource groups** blade and click on **VNet-rg** to check for the resources created in this resource group
    
    **Azure Virtual Network** along with Network security groups is created for providing an isolated network and subnets for your virtual machine.

#### Task 2: Update the Azure migrate landing zone blueprint sample to match with DMZ Architecture

In this task you will update the VNET Landing zone to deploy a virtual network that follows the **DMZ architecture**.

The architecture implements a DMZ, also called a **perimeter network**, between the on-premises network and an Azure virtual network.
 
**Azure virtual network**: The virtual network hosts the application and other resources running in Azure.
**Network security groups:** Use security groups to restrict network traffic within the virtual network. For example, in the deployment provided with this reference architecture, the web tier subnet allows TCP traffic from the on-premises network and from within the virtual network,the business tier allows traffic from the web tier and the data tier allows traffic from the business tier.

In this architecture, **Azure Firewall** is a managed firewall as a service, all inbound and outbound traffic passes through azure firewall and the Firewall instance is placed in its own subnet and it is deployed in the virtual network to control traffic between the gateway's subnet and the subnet in which the application tier runs. In this way Azure Firewall is cost effective because it's used as a shared solution consumed by multiple workloads.
Virtual network routes: Virtual network routes define the flow of IP traffic within the Azure virtual network. In the screenshot shown above, there are two user-defined route tables. 
- In the **gateway subnet**, traffic sent to the web-tier subnet (10.0.1.0/24) is routed through the Azure Firewall instance.
- In the **web tier subnet**, Since there is no route for address space of the VNet itself to point to Azure firewall, web tier instances are able to communicate directly to each other, not via Azure Firewall.

- And Azure **Bastion** allows you to log into VMs in the virtual network through SSH or remote desktop protocol (RDP) without exposing the VMs directly to the internet. Use Bastion to manage the VMs in the virtual network.
  
### Deploy the Virtual Network which implements a DMZ architecture.

1. Navigate to **Blueprints->Assigned blueprints** and select **Assignment-L1-Migrationlandingzone** then click on **Unassign blueprint** to unassign the previously assigned blueprint.
   
   ![](images/ex1-17-unassignbp.png)
